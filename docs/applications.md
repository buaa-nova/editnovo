# Applications of editnovo

_De novo_ peptide sequencing has diverse applications in proteomics, ranging from antibody sequencing to paleoproteomics.
You can find some papers that use editnovo for _de novo_ sequencing in different domains below.
Contact us with your applications of editnovo to feature your research on this page by opening a Github issue with a link to the paper and a one-sentence description of how editnovo is being used.

- **[Comprehensive evaluation of peptide _de novo_ sequencing tools for monoclonal antibody assembly (Beslic et al., *Briefings in Bioinformatics*, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbac542)**: editnovo is used to _de novo_ sequence monoclonal antibodies and shown to outperform other _de novo_ sequencing tools.
- **[Giant genes are rare but implicated in cell wall degradation by predatory bacteria (West-Roberts et al., *bioRxiv*, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.21.568195)**: editnovo is used to _de novo_ sequence giant proteins with up to 85,804 amino acids in a metagenomic setting.
- **[Cryo-EM reveals that cardiac IGLV6-derived AL fibrils can be polymorphic (Bassett et al., *bioRxiv*, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.04.626857)**: editnovo is used to _de novo_ sequence fibrils, i.e. antibody light chain aggregates.
- **[_De novo_ assembled databases enable species-specific protein-based stable isotope probing of microbiomes without prior knowledge of the community composition (Klaes et al., *bioRxiv*, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.25.625156)**: editnovo is used to _de novo_ sequence microbial peptides to enable species-specific protein-based stable isotope probing.
- **[Systematic benchmarking of mass spectrometry-based antibody sequencing reveals methodological biases (Chernigovskaya et al., *bioRxiv*, 2024)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.11.622451)**: editnovo is used to profile the sequence diversity of circulating monoclonal antibody repertoire.
